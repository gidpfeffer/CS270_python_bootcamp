## Imports

Imports are necessary to prevent all code from being kept in one file. The following examples discuss how to import libraries that come with python as well as how to import code written by the user.

The Python 3 Standard Library can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). Pip is Python's package manager and it is the general tool used to download additional libraries. More information can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).
